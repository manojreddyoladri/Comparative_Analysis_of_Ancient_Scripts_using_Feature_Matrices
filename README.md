# Comparative_Analysis_of_Ancient_Scripts_using_Feature_Matrices

Ancient scripts can be compared visually using feature matrices that list the features of each sign in the scripts. This project is a Python program that takes input as feature matrices of two different scripts and returns a similarity matrix of the two scripts.

Below is the Old Hungarian-Elder Futhark similrity matrix.

The greatest value in each row is marked in red, the greatest value in each column is marked in blue, and the greatest value in both a row and column is marked in purple. Overall, the distribution is fairly random. Many values are also quite low. Most importantly however, few high numbers appear along the diagonal. This could be because the letters are not in the same order (same sounding letters should appear in the same order).
